## Self-Hosting

This guide won't be that detailed since I don't meant for this bot to be self-hosted. However, if you want to:

### Prerequisites:
- A Discord bot user
- Node.js v20 or higher

### Installation:
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up `.env` (rename `.env.example` to `.env`)
> `DISCORD_TOKEN` : The bot's token
3. Set up `config.json` (rename `config.example.json` to `config.json`)
> `prefix` : The bot's prefix

### Running the bot:
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
